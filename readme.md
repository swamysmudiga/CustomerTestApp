# Test WPF/MVVM/Microservice application

We'd like to suggest that you finalize test application (CustomerTestApp).
This is a simple customer editor, you should have a stylized list of customers on the left side and the customer editor on the right.

# Requirements
- Use naming conventions for C# ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/identifier-names](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/identifier-names)) and code conventions for C# ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)). Correct and format existing source code according to these conventions. Also structurize all files if it necessary.
- Where appropriate, apply the four pillars of OOPs: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- Also, place fields, constructors, properties, methods, etc. so that they don't overlap with each other and stick to this style in all your classes. Also, you can use regions.

## WPF
- Don't use code behind in *.xaml.cs.
- Implement styles (Don't use repeating markup elements and instead it to use styles)
- Consider implicitly and explicitly applying styles and make the optimal choice in your opinion. ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/controls/how-to-create-apply-style](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/controls/how-to-create-apply-style)) 
- Split your main view on two vertical parts, create two different views: one - for list of the customers, second - for editing the selected customer from list.
- Make those two parts resizable with each other and set minimal size for each part.
- In the first view add ListBox for customer's list and for each customer implement template with name of customer, email, discount (in percents (add % to number)) and button Remove customer. Layout, formatting make in your opinion.
- Implement the command Remove customer, and implement that some customers cannot be deleted (for ex., predefined customers from your CustomerService you can't remove, but customers that you added from app you can remove.). Remove button should be automatically set to disabled.
- Try to implement Messenger and use Remove customer message for delete customer. ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/communitytoolkit/mvvm/messenger](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/communitytoolkit/mvvm/messenger)). For simplify, use it as singleton, also you can use just two methods, to register/receive messages and to send messages. Use Messenger to exchange the messages between view models.
- Implement the command Add customer and add it to view as button. Update view using Messenger after adding customer if it was valid.
- Don't use models for binding to view. Use view model. Also, any models shouldn't implement INotifyPropertyChanged.
- Implement base view model, from which you can inherit your concreate view models.
- Add TextBox and ComboBox(filtering type) for filtering by name or email for list of the customers. (empty string - show all customers, some text in the TextBox - show only customers, whose name or emailcontains entered text). Implement instantly filter applying.
- In the right part add TextBlock/Labels with descriptions, also add TextBox for editing properties (Name, email, discount) for selected customer from ListBox. Place them to your liking. Also add button for Save.
- Pay attention, editing an existing customer should not change the properties of the same customer in the ListBox. It should be updated only after the Save command is executed.
- If a customer is not selected, a blank (e.g. EmptyView) should be displayed.
- Add TextBox for show Id. The Id must be unique in a one application execution session. Pay attention, the Id must be read-only from the outside only and without repeating.
- Don't use fixed size for controls, use automatic content size adjustment, so that at any window size, the application would look more or less pretty.
- Implement a validate for Discount. Valid values are min = 0 and more, max = 30 and less. The save command should be inactive if incorrect values are entered, as well as blank values for name and email.
- Add the necessary code for CustomerService (CRUD) and where appropriate.

## ASP.NET
gRPC [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/grpc/?view=aspnetcore-8.0](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/grpc/?view=aspnetcore-8.0)

- Use gRPC [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/grpc/basics?view=aspnetcore-8.0](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/grpc/basics?view=aspnetcore-8.0) as the communication framework between the desktop application and the microservice.
- Use streamig calls when needed ([https://binodmahto.medium.com/streaming-with-grpc-on-net-34a57be520a1](https://binodmahto.medium.com/streaming-with-grpc-on-net-34a57be520a1)).
- Add the necessary code (service method, proto messages) for customerService.proto 
- Implement CRUD operation and filtration.
- Use logging framefork such as Serilog
[https://medium.com/@brucycenteio/adding-serilog-to-asp-net-core-net-7-8-5cba1d0dea2](https://medium.com/@brucycenteio/adding-serilog-to-asp-net-core-net-7-8-5cba1d0dea2)
[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/logging?tabs=command-line](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/logging?tabs=command-line)
- Add custom interceptor for logging [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/grpc/interceptors?view=aspnetcore-8.0](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/grpc/interceptors?view=aspnetcore-8.0).
- All service methods must be thread-safe.
- You can use List\<Customer> as a database. Be careful, using this collection can cause data races and multithreading problems.
- Insted of using plain instance List\<Customer> use repostory pattern to hide data acces details
[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/older-versions/getting-started-with-ef-5-using-mvc-4/implementing-the-repository-and-unit-of-work-patterns-in-an-asp-net-mvc-application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/older-versions/getting-started-with-ef-5-using-mvc-4/implementing-the-repository-and-unit-of-work-patterns-in-an-asp-net-mvc-application)
- Implement filtration customers by Email and Name
- Use dependecy injection for all services
- User metadata to pass calling application name to serice side. You can just log it [https://grpc.github.io/grpc/csharp/api/Grpc.Core.Metadata.html](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/csharp/api/Grpc.Core.Metadata.html)


### Will be a plus
- Use Entity framework instead of List\<Customer>. For demonstration you can use SQLite or in memory database [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/testing/testing-without-the-database#inmemory-provider](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/testing/testing-without-the-database#inmemory-provider)
- Logging into file or rolling file
- Do not use singeltion


**Good luck**
